This game is one that includes 3 different levels: 1,2,3
When the player uses their mouse to click a cell, it will reveal the cell
If the cell shows a number, this refers to how many mines there are around it

If the cell is a mine, the player will lose and the bottom status states it
If the player right clicks a cell, it will flag the cell as a blue. 
When the cell is flagged, the cell cannot be revealed. 
If the player clicks all the non-mines, then the status shows a win.
